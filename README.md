This is my final project submission for my Capstone and Cloud Computing courses. 
This app includes the ability for collecting, storing, retrieving, and reflecting user generated data. This app also includes the ability to filter based on type of place.
The vision for VAMOS is for it to become a social media platform where users can create travel guides surrounding a particular theme. Users can follow restaurants, influencers, and friends to view their guides. 
The cloud computing component of this app can be found on the Firebase.js module and allows the app to store and retrieve data from the Firestore Database in a "place_collection". 
This app primarily uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
